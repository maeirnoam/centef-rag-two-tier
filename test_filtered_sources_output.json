  "answer": "Terrorist financing (TF) methods are diverse and adaptable, ranging from small-scale, dispersed fundraising to large-scale support networks [FATF Terrorist Financing Typologies Report.pdf.coredownload.inline (2), Page 2]. Understanding these methods is crucial for disrupting terrorist activities [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 1].\n\nKey methods used in terrorism financing include:\n*   **Fundraising through social media:** Terrorists exploit social media's anonymity and broad reach to solicit donations, often integrating electronic payments [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 1]. Donors may be unaware of the ultimate beneficiaries [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 1].\n*   **Exploitation of natural resources:** Terrorist groups, such as ISIL, derive substantial funding from exploiting natural resources, often linked to criminal activities in areas with weak governance [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 1].\n*   **Abuse of non-profit organizations:** Terrorists may exploit charities and non-profit organizations to raise and move funds [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 2].\n*   **Criminal activities:** A range of criminal activities, from petty crime to organized fraud and narcotics smuggling, serve as significant funding sources [FATF Terrorist Financing Typologies Report.pdf.coredownload.inline (2), Page 2].\n*   **Private donations:** Terrorist groups receive funding through private donations [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 2].\n*   **Self-financing:** Terrorists may finance their activities through employment or welfare payments, sometimes referred to as \"black-washing\" [FATF Terrorist Financing Typologies Report.pdf.coredownload.inline (2), Page 2].\n*   **New payment methods:** New payment products and services, including virtual currencies and prepaid cards, offer speed and global accessibility, making end-user identification difficult [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 1].\n*   **Physical cash transportation:** Terrorists use physical cash couriers to move funds [FATF Terrorist Financing Typologies Report.pdf.coredownload.inline (2), Page 2].\n*   **Alternative remittance systems (ARS):** Terrorists utilize alternative remittance systems to move funds [FATF Terrorist Financing Typologies Report.pdf.coredownload.inline (2), Page 2].\n\nThese funds are used for various purposes, including operations, propaganda, recruitment, training, salaries, and even social services [Emerging-Terrorist-Financing-Risks.pdf.coredownload (5), Page 2].\n",
